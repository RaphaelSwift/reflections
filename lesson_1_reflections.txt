How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It allows to detect which lines have changed, either been added (++ or removed -- )
It saves a lot of time

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It allows to go back/restore to a previous version of a code if the new one doesn't work anymore
It allows you to see how the file has changed over time 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros : Choose the most approriate time to commit
Cons :  Forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It doesn't serve the same purpose, Git is for code and Google Docs for "Excel" "words" type of files, where everything is saved within one file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log allows to see all the commits that have been made and git diff show what was added and removed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It's easy to go back to a previous WORKING version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use GIT to save commit versions of my Swift code !
