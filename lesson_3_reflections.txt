When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
As a backup. To have access to the repository from anywhere. To share my repository easily.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because others persons might be working as well on the remote repository
