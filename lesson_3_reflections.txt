When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
As a backup. To have access to the repository from anywhere. To share my repository easily.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because others persons might be working as well on the remote repository 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork allows to copy on github a repository from someone else also present on github
Clone allows you to copy on your local disk a repository present on Github or alternatively on your local disk
Branch allows you to create new branches from your master branch
